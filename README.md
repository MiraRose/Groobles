# Groobles

## What is this?
This is me learning TypeScript and React by building a browser monster breeder.

## How do I play with it?
1. Clone it 
2. Open index page in browser. 

But there's nothing fun to do yet!

## I want to mess with the code!
1. Clone it
2. Make sure you are in an environment with Node
3. cd groobles
4. npm install
